# Hey 👋

## Glad to see you here!

I’m a self-taught front-end developer with a keen eye for clean and useful UI.

- 🌱 I began my _dev_ journey in 2022, driven by nostalgia for the days when social platforms let you express yourself with custom **HTML** and **CSS**.

- 💡 In 2023, my curiosity led me to finally discover **JavaScript** programming language.

- ⚛️ In 2024, I couldn’t stop my self from learning **React** and diving deeper into the React _ecosystem_.

- 🎨 Also, I experimented with various modern CSS tools, including **TailwindCSS**, **CSS Modules**, and **Styled Components**.

And now, my path continues with a growing curiosity in **TypeScript** and the **React Native** library.

Always open to exploring new and exciting tech domains.
